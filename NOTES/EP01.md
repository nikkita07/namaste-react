# LIBRARY VS FRAMEWORK 
# Library :  
=> predefined functions,classes that you use in your library. for ex: printf() in c.
=> not a software
=> Inversion of Control(IoC) : you call the library(in control)

# Framework : 
=> It's main function is helping you build a particular kind of application
=> is a software
=> Inversion of Control(IoC) : Framework calls your code(the control is inverted)
