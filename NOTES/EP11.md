 => Is a function that takes a component and returns a component   => a higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component.
 
# How it Works ?
Input to HOC:

=> The RestaurantCard is passed as an argument to the withPromotedLabel function.
Output of HOC:

=> withPromotedLabel creates and returns a new component (RestaurantCardPromoted) that:
