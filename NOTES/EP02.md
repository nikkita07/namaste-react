# steps to follow 
npm init : create package.json (config for npm) 
installing bundler : webpack,parcel,vite => packages your app do that it can be shipped to production.
//PARCEL is a library used in the project => npm install -D parcel 

#what is parcel and what will it do ?
packet bundler and uses: 
-Dev build 
-Local server
-HMR : hot module replacement 
-file watching algorithm
-reliable caching : for faster build
-minification and bundling 
-differential bundling : support older browsers
-Diagnostic => makes error handling easy
-Tree shaking algorithm :remove unused code 




# package.json vs package-lock.json
 => package.json => config for npm : keeps a track of all theversions installed in the app

 caret(^) : minor update and  tilde(~) : major update
  
=> package-lock.json  => keeps a log of exact version installed 



# Types of dependenies 
a) dev dependency : required in development phase and testing .  
//Dependencies that you need at some point in the development workflow but not while running your code
b) dependency (normal dependency): you need when running your code 
c) peerDependencies: means that your package needs a dependency that is the same exact dependency as the person installing your package.


//app.js
<!-- import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; -->

<!-- const parent = React.createElement("div",{id:"parent"},
    React.createElement("div",{id:"child"},
    [React.createElement("h1",{},"hello world from h2"),React.createElement("h3",{},"hello world from h3")]));
   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(parent); -->

    //index.html
    <script src="./app.js"></script> // will trow and error saying browser scripts cannot have imports or exports 

    <script type="module" src="./app.js"></script>
    //will not be treated as normaal js file but as module
