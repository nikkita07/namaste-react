MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE :
=> all software components are in a single code base and perform multiple business functions.
=> To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming. 


MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE : 
=> software is broken down into smaller, independent services that each perform a single function.
=>  Microservices donâ€™t reduce complexity, but they make any complexity visible and more manageable by separating tasks into smaller processes that function independently of each other and contribute to the overall whole.
